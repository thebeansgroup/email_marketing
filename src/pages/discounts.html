  text="... and that was Big Yellow Taxi by Joni Mitchell, a song in which Joni complains that they paved paradise to put up a parking lot. A measure which actually would have alleviated traffic congestion on the outskirts of paradise, something which Joni singularly fails to point out - perhaps because it doesnâ€™t quite fit in with her blinkered view of the world. Nevertheless, nice song."
